# UltraTracker

UltraTracker is a Python program designed to provide tools for fine-tuning audio settings and improving sound quality on Windows. The program currently supports basic gain adjustment and offers a foundation for further audio processing enhancements.

## Features

- **Gain Adjustment**: Modify the gain level of audio output to enhance sound quality.
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Processes audio data in real-time, applying user-defined settings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyAudio
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `UltraTracker.py` file.
2. Run the program using Python:
   ```bash
   python UltraTracker.py
   ```
3. Adjust the gain level within the script by modifying the `ultra_tracker.set_gain()` line.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional audio processing features such as equalization, noise reduction, and more.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Support for different audio formats and output devices.
